# Background

This document describes the theoretical motivation and conceptual origins of the K0 system.

It is non-normative and provides contextual foundation for understanding the K0 specification framework.

## Overview

The K0 system establishes a deterministic, machine-readable foundation for RIS (Reflexive Information System) architectures. It defines a minimal kernel of objects, rules, and verification mechanisms that enable reproducible, auditable system specifications.

## Key Concepts

- **Deterministic Builds**: Every release is fully reproducible from source
- **Provenance Tracking**: Cryptographic hashes and metadata for all artifacts
- **Machine-Readable Specification**: Structured data with unambiguous semantics
- **Verification-First Approach**: All components are subject to automated validation

## Purpose

This background document serves as an introduction to the philosophical and technical motivations behind K0, separate from the normative specifications.
