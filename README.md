## Normative Corridor (K0)

The following directories and files constitute the normative basis of this release:

- `bundle_root/` (including `kernel/objects_K0.json`)
- `release/` (including `provenance/manifest.json` and `provenance/provenance.json`)
- `spec/` (`*_SPEC_v1_0.md`)

These artifacts are versioned, verified, and form the canonical release corridor.

### Non-normative content

The `docs/` directory and its Markdown files are illustrative and non-binding.  
Path references within these documents are examples only; missing targets do not imply release defects.
